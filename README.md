# Case Service
This repository contains the Case service. This microservice is a RESTful web service implemented using [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/). It manages cases, where a case represents an expected response from an sample unit such as a business or a household. Every sample unit in the survey sample must have at least one associated case. Each case can have multiple questionnaires associated with it, but it must have at least one. Each questionnaire has a question set and a Unique Access Code (UAC). Interesting things that happen during the life cycle of a case are recorded as case events. Case life cycle transitions are published as JMS messages for interested parties to subscribe to.

## Running
    mvn clean install
    cd casesvc
